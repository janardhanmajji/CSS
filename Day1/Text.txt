Things to keep in mind while designing a website:

- What the users are looking for? : Don't go fancy for every website.
- Easy navigation
- Website must look pretty..

Step1: Linking HTML and CSS

Using link tag just before the end of head tag..
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />

To target a specific tag we use class.
<h1 class="class-name"></h1>

- The class-name can be anything must must be meaningful.
- This class-name is used in CSS with the help of "."
- We can comment anything with the help of Ctrl+ '/' => Shortcut

Box Model:

Q1. When do we use a div?
A: When we need to club things together => need to apply the same property for particular set of elements...
   By Default it doesn't have any input on it's own.

Box model consists of 3 things:
- Border
- Padding
- Margin

Border:
- Consists properties of thickness, style[solid, dotted, dashed] and color.
- Used to draw a border around a div or any such component

Padding:

- Used to create space between the border and the content inside the border
- padding: 50px;

Margin: 

- Used to create space outside the border
- Syntax: margin: 50px;

---------------------------------------------------

Border-radius: Used to make the border rounded...

Q. When to use % and when to use px?
A: % is used when we refer to the parent element and px is used to define particularly that specific element..

img{
    width: 100% => Fits inside the box as the parent element is box-model
}

Q. How to center a div?
A: put a margin and give margin:auto which gives equal space from both left and right and the div is centered

*** Box-sizing: border-box ensures that the element is not going out of the parent element. 
We can add the necessary padding and margin..
